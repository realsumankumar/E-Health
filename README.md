# E-Health
E-Health system proposes to manage the complete lifecycle of patient’s health information. It leverages a concept called Electronic Health Record (EHR). An EHR is a digital version of a patient’s paper chart. EHRs are real-time, patient-centered records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users. While an EHR does contain the medical and treatment histories of patients, an EHR system is built to go beyond standard clinical data collected in a provider’s office and can be inclusive of a broader view of a patient’s care.

An EHR can contain the following, but not limited to:
1.Contain a patient’s medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory and test results
2.Allow access to evidence-based tools that providers can use to make decisions about a patient’s care
3.Automate and streamline provider workflow
